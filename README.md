FRC Team 2501's 2015 Stable Release

This robot code was designed for use with FRC Team 2501's 2015 robot, designed to compete in Recycle Rush, a gamemode where robots had to do a diverse set of tasks, including stacking totes and recycling cans, stuffing a pool noodle in the recycling can, autonomous driving, and navigating around a small game field with obstacles and 5 other robots. 

FRC Team 2501 and FIRST Robotics seek to provide an exciting, engaging, and intellectually challenging space for young minds to learn hands on skills in programming, electronics, digital fabrication, machining, and marketing. Team 2501 is a great space for students to be as invovled as they are able, while still getting the most out of the time there. Students can come to build time for a few hours a week, or a few hours a day, but no matter how much time they spend with the team, they are sure to grow as a student, as a person, and as a future professional.
